# ☀️ 2D Pixel Path Tracing Engine
2D Pixel Path Tracing Engine was developed using Python and the Pygame library. The engine allows you to create and visualize lighting effects in a 2D grid environment. You can add light sources, solid obstacles, and even a flashlight to observe how light interacts with the environment.

## Features
* Light Sources: You can place multiple light sources on the grid to see how they illuminate the surroundings.
* Solid Obstacles: Add solid obstacles to block the path of light, casting shadows and affecting the lighting in the scene.
* Flashlight: Use a flashlight tool to dynamically explore the scene and observe how it interacts with obstacles and other light sources.
* UI Interface: The engine provides a user interface for selecting tools and managing the environment.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.
3. Run the main_menu() function to start the engine.
4. In the main menu, you can click the "Run" button to start the engine, which allows you to interact with the environment.
5. Inside the engine:
     * Use the left mouse button to interact with the environment. Depending on the selected tool (Light, Solid, or Flashlight), you can add light sources, solid obstacles, or use the flashlight.
     * The UI on the left side allows you to select tools and provides visual feedback for tool selection.
6. Experiment with different scenarios and observe how light and shadows are calculated in real time.
